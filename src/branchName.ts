//
// `git checkout -b` refuses a name it doesn't like, which arrives here as a
// failed action and a red message — the name is gone, and what was wrong with
// it is written in git's words ("fatal: 'my branch' is not a valid branch
// name"). Since the rules are fixed and short, the field can keep to them
// instead: the characters git refuses are never typed, and the few problems
// that are about the shape of the whole name are said before Enter does
// anything.
//
// Capitals are deliberately left alone. Git takes them — `Feature/Login` is a
// perfectly good branch — so a field that stripped them would be inventing a
// rule rather than enforcing one. What capitals DO cause is a collision on
// macOS and Windows, where `feature` and `Feature` are the same file in
// .git/refs, and that is caught below as the clash it actually is.

// Characters git refuses in a ref: ASCII control codes, space, and the seven
// it reserves for its own syntax (~ ^ : ? * [ and a backslash). See
// `git help check-ref-format`.
