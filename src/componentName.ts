// What a component may be called.
//
// A component's name is three things at once: the file on disk
// (src/components/Card.astro), the identifier the page imports it as, and the
// tag written in the markup. So it has to be a valid JS identifier, and it has
// to start with a capital — Astro reads a lowercase tag as an HTML element, so
// `<card />` renders a literal <card> nobody asked for rather than the
// component. Whatever gets typed in the name field ends up as all three, which
// is why what is typed is not what is saved: "Component name" is written down
// as ComponentName.

/**
 * The name a typed string becomes. Words are split on anything that can't be
 * in an identifier, and each is capitalised; the rest of a word is left as
 * typed, so `buttonArrow` becomes `ButtonArrow` rather than `Buttonarrow`.
