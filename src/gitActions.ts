// Merging and deleting a branch, as the user experiences them.

// Two places offer these now — the chip in the title bar and the History
// panel — and they are the same actions, so they are asked the same way from
// one place. What differs between the two callers is only how the work is run
// (the chip has a busy state and an error box; the panel does not), so that is
// the one thing passed in.
//
// The refusals these can hit are worded in electron/gitBranches.js. What lives
// here is the asking: which questions get put to the user, in what order, and
// in what words.
