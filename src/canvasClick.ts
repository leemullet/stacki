// What a click on the canvas means.
//
// The canvas answers a click with the path of the deepest node it can map under
// the pointer, IN THE SCOPE OF THE OPEN FILE — or null when it can't map one at
// all. Null is the interesting case, because it has two very different causes:
//
//   the click landed somewhere this file doesn't own — the page around an open
//   component, the layout's own header — which is somebody looking away from
//   what they were editing;
//
//   the click landed on something inside it that carries no marker. Content
//   passed into a slot belongs to the caller, an expression the marker
//   serializer can't wrap emits nothing, a text node has no element of its own.
//   That is the canvas saying "I don't know", not the user saying anything.
//
// Backing out of a component on either one is why clicking inside a component
// kept closing it. Leaving is a real action with real cost — the panel switches
// files and the selection is lost — so it takes a click the canvas could map
// somewhere else. An unmappable one changes nothing.

/**

 *                                        file/instance — the canvas narrows to
 *                                        the instance being edited, so a click
 *                                        on the page around it arrives with no
 *                                        path and this flag
 * @param {string|null} click.focusPath   the instance being edited, or null
 * @param {string} click.scope            the open file's path prefix ('' for a page)
 * @returns {{ kind: 'inner'|'select'|'layout'|'close'|'nothing' }}
 *   inner   — a node in the component being edited: select it
 *   select  — a node in the open page: select it
 *   layout  — chrome the layout renders itself: select the layout node
 *   close   — leave the component
 *   nothing — the canvas couldn't say; leave everything as it is
