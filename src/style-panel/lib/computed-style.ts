// What a control shows when nothing in the panel sets its property.
//
// The resolved model only knows what the project's CSS declares. A control whose
// property nobody declares still isn't showing nothing on the page: `pointer-events`
// may be `none` because a parent set it, `text-align` may be `center` from a `*` rule
// the panel's matcher can't see past a component edge, and `display` is whatever the
// user-agent stylesheet says for that tag. Guessing the CSS initial value gets all
// three wrong.
//
// So the page is asked, the same way colours are (see computed-color.ts): the canvas
// runs getComputedStyle on the selected element and hands back the values. Controls
// use it to HIGHLIGHT an option — never to claim the property is set, which stays the
// resolved model's call (the label is dim either way).
