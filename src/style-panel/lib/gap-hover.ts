// Hovering `padding-top` already draws the strip of the element that padding
// holds open. Gap had nothing: the number changed and the only way to see what
// it had done was to look at the page and compare. But a gap is easier to show
// than padding, not harder — it is the space between things, and the canvas
// knows exactly where that is.
//
// Two fields in two files own gap (the layout section's and the grid one's),
// so the behaviour lives here rather than being written twice and drifting.
//
// Hover and focus both light it, and it goes out only when NEITHER holds: a
// field can be pointed at and typed into at once, and leaving on either one
// would take down an outline the other still wants.
