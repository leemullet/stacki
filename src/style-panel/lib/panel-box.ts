// panel edge. Every one of them clamps itself back inside — but they were
// written against moden, where `.app_body` is both the visible panel and the
// scroll container, and this app has neither: the panel is `.style-panel-host`
// wrapping `.embed-editor_root`, and that root is the scroller (overflow-y:
// auto, overflow-x: clip — see styles.css).
//
// Falling back to `document.documentElement` there was the bug: the menus were
// clamped to the WINDOW, so no shift was ever applied, and the panel's
// overflow-x clipped whatever hung past its edge.
