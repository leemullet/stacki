// Turning a layer off without throwing it away.
//
// A transform, a filter, a transition — you want to see the element without it
// for a moment, and then you want it back. Deleting the layer and retyping it
// from memory is the only way the panel used to offer, so "is this blur doing
// anything?" cost you the blur.
//
// So a hidden layer is COMMENTED OUT in place:
//
//     filter: blur(5px) /* brightness(0.5) */;
//
// The browser ignores it, the element renders without it, and every character
// of it is still sitting in the stylesheet where it was. Turning it back on
// removes the comment markers and nothing else. Nothing is stored anywhere but
// the CSS, so a hidden layer survives a reload, a branch switch, and being
// opened in an editor that has never heard of this panel.
//
// The separator differs by property and the list splitting has to respect it:
// `transition` is comma-separated, `filter` and `transform` are space-separated,
// and both can hold functions with commas or spaces INSIDE their parentheses
// (`rgba(0, 0, 0, .5)`, `translate(1px 2px)`) which must not be split on.

 * two-layer value came back with four layers in it.
