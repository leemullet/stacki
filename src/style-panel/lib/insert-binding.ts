// `2rem` becomes `var(--space-6)` and that is the entire edit. But it is
// destructive the moment the value is an expression — picking a variable inside
// `calc(100% - 2rem)` threw away the calc, and the only way to get it back was
// undo and a retype.
//
// So the value decides. A plain value is replaced, because replacing it is what
// picking a variable means there. Anything with structure to lose has the
// variable put in at the caret instead, and keeps everything around it.
