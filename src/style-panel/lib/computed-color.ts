// What a colour value actually looks like, on the element it applies to.
//
// A swatch used to paint the value straight into the panel's own DOM, which
// works for `#c6fb50` and fails for everything that depends on where it lives:
// `var(--background)` is not defined in the app's document, so it painted
// nothing (a transparent chequerboard), and `color-mix(in srgb, var(--brand)
// 20%, transparent)` the same. Worse, those values are not even constant —
// the same variable resolves differently under a theme class, a colour scheme
// or a container query, so there is no static answer to look up.
//
// So the page is asked. The canvas resolves the value against the selected
// element (see the `compute` half of avb:query) and hands back the computed
// colour, which is what the swatch paints.
