// The selected segment of a segmented bar, as one pill that slides to it rather
// than a background on each segment taking its turn. The same thing moving is
// one control answering; four things blinking in turn is four controls.
//
// Eight controls in this panel are the same bar — Display, Direction, Overflow,
// Position, Size's two, Borders, Typography's, the flex-child one — sharing the
// `embed-editor_display` track and `embed-editor_display-seg` buttons, and
// differing only in what their segments say and in how each decides which one
// is on. So this reads the selection off the class they all already set,
// instead of asking eight components to compute an index and thread refs to
// their buttons. The shared class IS the contract between them; anything that
// marks a segment selected gets the pill for free, including the ones whose
// rule is odd (a panel toggle, a "mixed" state).
//
// Drop it inside the track as the first child. It measures its own siblings.
