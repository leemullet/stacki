// The page reports a node's boxes as a list — a node inside a loop is on the
// page once per item, and each copy is meant to be outlined separately. But
// the same *place* can come back several times over: a component whose markup
// is split across several marked runs, an element the page's own scripts
// cloned, a piece that measures to the same rect as the whole. Drawing those
// is not just redundant, it is wrong: the overlays are translucent, so two of
// them over the same pixels is twice the tint and fourteen is a wash. A
// section hovered from the navigator turned solid green that way — 14% painted
// fourteen times is 88%, which is a page you can no longer read.
//
// So a box is dropped when a box already kept covers it. Separate instances
// never contain one another, so they all survive.

// A pixel of slack: rects come from getBoundingClientRect and a box that is
// "the same" as another is rarely the same to six decimal places.

 * every copy. A selection made from the canvas says which copy it means; any
 * other route means "the node", which is every copy of it.
 *
 * That is right for a jump across the tree and wrong for a step within it.
 * Pressing ↑ from the second link in a list selects its parent — and the parent
 * of the SECOND one, which is the copy the reader is looking at. Stepping down
 * into a child, or across to a sibling, is the same move. So a step to an
 * ancestor, a descendant or a sibling keeps the copy; anything further away
 * starts again at the first.
 *
 * Paths are index trails, so all three are answered by comparing them. A path
 * carrying a file namespace (`src/Card.astro|0.1`) belongs to that file: a step
 * into another file's markup is not a step within a copy.
