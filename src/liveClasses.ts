// else, so no element on the page is theirs: nothing carries their name,
// nothing has their classes, nothing measures as them.
//
// The page can only answer about elements, and it answers by path — so asked
// what `<Fragment slot="column2">` rendered with, the canvas finds the element
// between its markers and hands back what it found. That element is the root
// `<div class="feature-image_wrap">` of the component the Fragment holds, and
// it answers to the Fragment's path on purpose: it is how a click inside the
// slot finds its way back to the node that put it there.
//
// So the canvas cannot tell them apart, and it should not have to. The model
// knows: a Fragment is a Fragment. Without that, the navigator labelled the
// Fragment's row `feature-image_wrap` and drew the component beneath it — a
// component's own root shown as a page element wrapping the component.
