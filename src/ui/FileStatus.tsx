// What happened to a file, in a word.

// Git says "M". It also says "A", "D" and "R", and every one of them is
// shorthand for people who already know the shorthand — which, in an editor
// built so that nobody needs to learn git first, is nobody. A letter that
// needs a tooltip to explain it is a letter that should have been a word.
//
// The words are short enough to sit where the letter did, so nothing had to
// grow to make room for being readable.
