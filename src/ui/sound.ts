// Off unless the setting says otherwise — an editor that makes noise the first
// time you touch it is an editor people turn off, so this one starts silent and

// the first note is asked for, so a session with the setting off never creates

// "Muted" is meant as an instrument does: a saw through a low-pass, quiet, with
// a soft attack and a quick decay. No click at either end, and nothing that
// carries across a room.

// The drag has two axes and so does the note. Across is pitch. Up and down is
// how hard it is played: at the bottom the filter is nearly shut and the note
// is round and slow, at the top it is open and the note is bright and struck.
// One waveform throughout — a sawtooth has the harmonics to be either, and the
// filter decides how many of them are heard, which is what a mute is.

// The scale. A minor pentatonic over two octaves: any two notes in it sit well
// together, so a fast drag reads as a run rather than a siren — which a linear
// sweep through frequencies is. Dragging right climbs it, dragging left comes
