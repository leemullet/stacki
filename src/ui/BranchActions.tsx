// The merge and delete buttons on a branch row.
//
// Shared, because the chip and the History panel both list branches and a row
// that behaves differently in two places is two things to learn.
//
// Two decisions here, both of them about being honest rather than tidy:
//
// ALWAYS SHOWN. They used to appear on hover, which meant that until you
// happened to hover a row there was no sign the app could merge or delete
// anything at all. A feature nobody can find is not a feature. They sit dim
// and come up on hover, so the row stays quiet without the actions being a
// secret.
//
// SHOWN EVEN WHERE THEY CANNOT BE USED, disabled and with the reason on them.
// The alternative — hiding them — asks the reader to work out why a row is
// missing something, and "why does this branch have no delete button?" is a
// worse question than a greyed button that says "you're on this branch".
//
// What each button is refused for:
//
//   merge   only into a DIFFERENT branch. Merging main into the branch you are
//           working on is completely ordinary and stays available — it is how
//           you catch up with the trunk — so the only refusal is a branch
//           against itself.
//   delete  not the branch you are standing on (git refuses), and not the
//           trunk. Git will delete main as readily as anything else the moment
//           it is merged into where you are, and it is the one branch
//           everything comes back to.
