// modal in the style panel already says what it is — `role="menu"`,
// `role="dialog"`, `role="listbox"` — and a rule written against that is one a
// new popup obeys without being added to a list. Tooltips are `role="tooltip"`
// and deliberately not included: they appear on hover, and a panel that stopped
// scrolling because the pointer paused over a segment would be worse than the
// problem this solves.

 * direct child of it, and the host in full, since an inline menu appears deep
 * inside a control. Watching all of <body>'s subtree would mean a callback on
