// Which entry of a dynamic route ([slug].astro) the canvas is rendered against.
//
// The route itself is a pattern, so there is nothing to preview until one of
// getStaticPaths' entries is chosen — /posts/[slug] is a 404, /posts/hello is a
// page. Only the data changes here: the template is shared by every entry, so
// whatever gets edited applies to all of them.
//
// Every option is a page that a collection generates, so it reads as one: the
// page glyph and the purple the rest of the app gives generated routes, in the
// Pages panel and the title bar. The list is as long as the collection is, so
// it is always searchable — a threshold would only mean the box appears when a
// project crosses some number of posts, which is a worse thing to learn than
// "the box is always there".
//
// Live preview is off. Each option is a full page navigation, so skimming the
// list would reload the canvas once per hover.
