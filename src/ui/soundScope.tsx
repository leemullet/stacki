// The two design panels do — the style panel and the settings panel. A note
// under the pointer is feedback for shaping something, and that is what those
// two are for. The title bar, the pages list and the terminal's own controls
// are not: a sound there would be the app talking about itself.
//
// A context rather than a class on a wrapper, because a dropdown's menu portals
// to <body>. The DOM then says it is nowhere near the panel; the React tree
// says exactly where it came from, which is the honest answer and the same one
// the panels' click handler relies on.
