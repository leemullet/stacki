// What a `slot=` still means once the node carrying it has been moved.
//
// `slot="column2"` is not a property of the element. It is a word addressed to
// the component the element sits inside — "put me in the slot you call
// column2" — and nobody else is listening. Drag that element out into a plain
// <div>, or into a component with no such slot, and the attribute is a note to
// a reader who has left: Astro renders the element in the default slot, or
// nowhere at all, and the markup says something that is no longer true.
//
// So the question on a move is not "did the parent change" but "is there still
// something here that this word means anything to".
