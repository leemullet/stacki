// How big the window opens.
//
// It used to open at a fixed 1480×940 — a size chosen for a laptop, and on
// anything larger a window with the desk showing around it. The app is a canvas
// with panels down both sides, so every pixel it isn't using is one the page
// being built isn't shown in: it opens filled instead.
//
// Filled means the work area, not the screen: the menu bar and the Dock are the
// operating system's, and a window drawn under them is a window with its title
// bar out of reach. Full screen proper is a different thing — a space of its
// own, which is the user's choice to make, not the app's to make for them.
