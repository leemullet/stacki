// `<p>&copy;&#160;{SITE_NAME}</p>` renders as "© Remarkable". The navigator drew
// the row as `&copy;`, the Content field offered `&#160;` to edit, and both were
// showing the source's spelling of a character rather than the character. An
// editor over a rendered page has to say what the page says.
//
// So a text node holds the characters, and the file keeps its own spelling: an
// untouched node is written back exactly as it was found (the writer has the
// original to hand), and one that has been edited is written as its characters,
// with the three that would otherwise be markup put back into entities.

// The named entities that turn up in hand-written markup. Not the full HTML
// table — that is 2231 names, nearly all of them for characters nobody types —
// but everything an author reaches for, plus the five that are structural.
