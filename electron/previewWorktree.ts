// The checkout an old version is previewed from.
//
// Looking at what the site was like three commits ago means running it, and
// running it means having those files on disk somewhere. That somewhere is a
// git worktree: a second checkout of the same repository, at whatever commit
// is being looked at, with the real working tree left completely alone. The
// user's own files never move, which is what makes previewing safe enough to
// offer as a button.
//
// Three things about the design were established by trying them, and each one
// is the opposite of the obvious choice:
//
//   1. THE WORKTREE LIVES INSIDE THE PROJECT, at `.stacki/preview`.
//      The obvious home is the app's own data directory, out of the way. But a
//      worktree has no node_modules, and the fix for that — symlinking the
//      project's — breaks Astro: Node resolves the symlink to its real path
//      before resolving subpath exports, so `astro/app` is looked for relative
//      to the real node_modules while Vite's root is the worktree, and the
//      server dies with "Cannot find module 'astro/app'". Put the checkout
//      inside the project instead and there is no symlink at all: resolution
//      walks up from `.stacki/preview` and finds the project's real
//      node_modules the ordinary way.
//
//   2. IT IS HIDDEN FROM GIT THROUGH .git/info/exclude, NOT .gitignore.
//      .gitignore is the user's file, tracked and committed; writing to it
//      would show up as a change they did not make and would follow them into
//      a commit. info/exclude is local, untracked, and exactly for this.
//
//   3. ONE WORKTREE PER PROJECT, MOVED RATHER THAN MULTIPLIED.
//      A worktree per commit is a full copy of the project per commit. This
//      one is checked out again at each new ref, so the disk cost is one
//      checkout no matter how much history gets browsed.
//
// The dev server that runs against it is spawned by main.js, which owns ports
// and process handling. Everything here is the filesystem and git side, so it
// can be tested (test/preview-worktree.js) without booting Astro.
