// Moving the working tree through time: saving a version, and going back to
// one.
//
// gitHistory.js only reads and gitBranches.js is about branches; these are the
// operations that change what is on disk right now. They are together because
// they are the same promise from two directions — "this is safe to try,
// because you can get back to here" is only true if both halves work.
//
// The rule the restores follow, and the reason they are safe to offer to
// someone who does not know git: **nothing is ever thrown away silently.**
// Restoring a file leaves the old contents as an uncommitted change, which the
// user can discard. Restoring the whole project parks what was there first, so
// the work is recoverable even though the tree no longer shows it. Neither
// rewrites history — going back is itself something you can come back from.
