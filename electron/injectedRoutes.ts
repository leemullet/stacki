// Pages that are not files in this project.
//
// A site's routes usually are its files: `src/pages/about.astro` is `/about`,
// and the editor opens the one to change the other. They don't have to be. An
// Astro integration can call injectRoute() for every page it ships, and then a
// site consists of a config file and nothing else — the pages live inside a
// dependency (github.com/flowtricks/stacki/issues/7).
//
// Nothing on disk names those routes, so the dev server is asked instead: as
// Astro resolves its routes it hands the list to integrations, and the preview
// config writes it beside the other things it reports. This reads that list.
//
// Preview only, deliberately. Their source is in node_modules, where an edit
// is undone by the next install and renaming or deleting is not the editor's
// business — so these never join the page list the editor writes through.
