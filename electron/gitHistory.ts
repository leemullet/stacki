// Reading history.
//
// Everything else this app does to git changes something. This is the half
// that only looks: the log, what a commit touched, what is changed right now,
// a file as it was, and which worktrees exist. Nothing here writes.
//
// It is a separate module from gitBranches.js for the same reason that one
// exists — so it can be tested against real repositories (test/git-history.js)
// rather than only through the app — and it takes the `git` runner as its
// first argument for the same reason: main.js runs git through a PATH it has
// had to repair for the packaged app, and the tests run it plainly.
//
// The traps here are all in git's output rather than in its behaviour, and
// each one is the kind that produces a plausible wrong answer rather than an
// error:
//
//   - `git show --name-status` on a MERGE commit prints NOTHING. Not an error,
//     not a diff — an empty list, because a diff against several parents is
//     ambiguous and git declines to pick. A history panel reading it straight
//     would draw every merge as a commit that changed no files.
//   - A repository with no commits yet makes `git log` exit 128. That is a new
//     project, not a failure, and it has to read as an empty history.
//   - A rename is one path in the working tree and two in a commit, so the
//     record for it has a field the others do not.
//
// Paths come back in git's own terms. Turning `src/pages/index.astro` into
// "Home" needs the project's routing, which lives in main.js — so that
// translation happens at the IPC edge, and this module stays about git.

//                      you are standing. Without it, merges come back empty.
//   -M                 detect renames, so a moved page reads as a move rather
//                      than as one file deleted and an unrelated one added.
//
// NOT `-m --first-parent`, which gives the same diffs and looks equivalent.
// On `git log`, `--first-parent` also changes which commits are LISTED: it
// stops following the second parent of a merge, so every commit made on a
// branch disappears from the history the moment that branch is merged. The
// timeline would quietly lose the work it exists to show, with the merge still
// sitting there as if nothing had come with it.
//
// `--diff-merges` only ever affects the diff, which is all that was wanted.
