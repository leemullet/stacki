// Moving one edit out of a re-serialized file and onto the original.
//
// Some formats can only be written by handing the whole document back to a
// serializer, and a serializer has opinions: it may unfold a wrapped scalar,
// re-pad a flow list, or normalise a quote the author chose. Those differences
// are harmless to the data and terrible in a diff, because they bury the one
// line that actually changed.
//
// The way out is to serialize twice — once from the untouched document, once
// from the edited one — and compare those two, not the original. Both came out
// of the same serializer, so its opinions cancel out and what is left is the
// edit. That is then placed back into the original text, which is otherwise
// untouched, byte for byte.
