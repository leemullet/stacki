// Is the dev server serving a page, or an error?
//
// A compile error replaces the site with the dev server's own error screen —
// served with a 5xx, and carrying none of the HMR client the real page has. So
// nothing inside it can hear the file being fixed, and the preview sits on the
// error until something reloads it. Deciding when to reload means being able to
// ask this question, and the HTTP status is the only answer that doesn't depend
// on recognising the error screen's markup or parsing the server's log — both of
// which change with every version of Astro and Vite.
