// What a click on the canvas means.
//
//   node test/canvas-click.js
//
// Double-click into a component, click something inside it, and it kept closing
// the component instead of selecting what was clicked.
//
// The canvas answers a click with the deepest path it can map under the pointer
// in the open file's scope — or null. Null has two causes that want opposite
// things: the click landed somewhere this file doesn't own (the page around an
// open component), or it landed on something inside it that carries no marker —
// content passed into a slot belongs to the caller, an expression the marker
// serializer can't wrap emits nothing, a text node has no element of its own.
//
// Backing out on either is what made a click inside a component throw you out of
// it. Leaving costs the selection and switches files; it takes a click the
// canvas could actually place somewhere else.
