// The watcher is there to notice edits made outside the app, and the app writes
// the same files itself all day. Every event has to be asked which it is.
//
// It was asked as a stopwatch — anything within a second of an app write was
// that write — and a second is a long time at a keyboard. Save a page in the
// app, save the same file in an editor a moment later, and the editor's change
// landed inside the window and was discarded: the model never reloaded, the
// canvas was never told, and the file went on looking unchanged. "Sometimes I
// don't see the latest changes unless I manually refresh" is that.
//
// A page with a <style> block was worse: the app writes it again 150ms later to
// make the dev server re-extract the styles, and each write restarts the
// stopwatch — about a second and a fifth of blindness after every save.
//
// The question is answerable exactly, because the app knows what it wrote.
