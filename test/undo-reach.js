//   node test/undo-reach.js
//
// Undo is a menu accelerator, so the key never reaches the page: whatever the
// handler in App.tsx decides is the only undo there is. It used to decide
//
//   if (pageStateRef.current.pageState && !cmsOpenRef.current) undo();
//
// which is "only while a page is open, and never in the CMS". Every view that
// is not a page recorded steps nobody could take: the variables panel, the
// assets panel, the CMS itself. A command carries its own inverse and needs no
// page open to run — and a snapshot with no page is dropped by undo() rather
// than applied, which is the case that guard was really about.
//
// The other half is typing. A field's undo belongs to the field: the app has no
// idea what was typed into a half-finished rename, and its own stack would jump
// somewhere else entirely. Since the accelerator swallows the key, the app has
// to hand that back deliberately.
//
// This is read from the source. The handler is three lines inside a 4700-line
// component wired to an Electron menu, and a harness able to render that would
// be testing itself.
